        <h1> Image-Based Password Security System</h1>
        <p>In another hackathon, we presented a unique authentication system using image-based passwords. The concept involved selecting specific points on an image in a sequence as a secure login method, designed to offer better protection against traditional threats like phishing and brute-force attacks. We received a participation certificate for our efforts and learned valuable skills in cybersecurity innovation and user experience design.</p>
